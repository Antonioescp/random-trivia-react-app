# It's time for Trivia!

This is a simple app that makes use of common concepts in [**React**](https://react.dev/) and consumes [**Open Trivia Database API**](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). Could be improved by adding animations and sfx to provide users with better feedback.

## How to run?
Run the good old `npm install` followed by a `npm run dev` since it is a vite application.

If you want to build it first, you can build with `npm run build` and run with something like `browser-sync -s ./dist`.

## Settings
you can change the amount of questions by changing `QUESTIONS_AMOUNT` and the countdown with `TIMER_DURATION` in `App.tsx`.
